## 1. Basic Concepts

### Q1: What is SSL and how does it differ from TLS?  
**A:** SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a network. TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure and efficient. SSL versions 2 and 3 are deprecated; modern systems use TLS 1.2 or 1.3.

### Q2: What is a digital certificate?  
**A:** A digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove ownership of a public key. It includes information such as the owner's identity, public key, expiration date, and the digital signature of a Certificate Authority (CA) that validates the certificate.

### Q3: What is a Certificate Authority (CA)?  
**A:** A CA is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates, verifying the identity of the certificate holder and signing their certificate to establish trust.

## 2. Certificate Types & Formats

### Q4: What are the common SSL certificate types?  
**A:**  
- **Domain Validation (DV):** Verifies ownership of the domain only.  
- **Organization Validation (OV):** Validates domain and organization details.  
- **Extended Validation (EV):** Provides highest level of validation, showing the organization’s legal identity.

### Q5: What file formats are commonly used for certificates?  
**A:**  
- **PEM:** Base64 encoded, often with `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cer` extensions.  
- **DER:** Binary encoded, often `.der` or `.cer`.  
- **PFX/P12:** PKCS#12 format containing both private key and certificate, usually `.pfx` or `.p12`.  
- **JKS:** Java KeyStore format.

## 3. SSL/TLS Handshake & Encryption

### Q6: Explain the SSL/TLS handshake process.  
**A:** The handshake involves:  
1. Client Hello (propose SSL/TLS version and cipher suites)  
2. Server Hello (choose protocol and cipher suite)  
3. Server sends certificate (and optionally key exchange info)  
4. Client verifies server certificate  
5. Key exchange to establish a shared secret (using RSA, Diffie-Hellman, etc.)  
6. Both parties generate session keys  
7. Client and Server send Finished messages to confirm handshake  
8. Secure communication begins using symmetric encryption.

### Q7: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in SSL?  
**A:** Asymmetric encryption (public/private key) is used during handshake to securely exchange keys. Symmetric encryption uses a shared secret key for encrypting bulk data efficiently during the session.

## 4. Certificate Authorities & Trust Model

### Q8: What is a root CA and intermediate CA?  
**A:**  
- **Root CA:** The top-level trusted authority with a self-signed certificate.  
- **Intermediate CA:** Issued certificates by root CA to delegate signing authority and create a chain of trust.

### Q9: What is certificate chaining?  
**A:** Certificate chaining is the process of linking a server certificate through intermediate certificates up to a trusted root CA, enabling clients to verify the server’s identity.

## 5. SSL Implementation & Configuration

### Q10: How do you configure SSL on Nginx?  
**A:** By setting the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` directives to point to the cert and key files, enabling SSL, and optionally configuring protocols and cipher suites.

Example snippet:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/server.key;
    ...
}
```
## 6. Advanced Concepts

### Q11: What is mutual (two-way) SSL?  
**A:**  
Mutual SSL requires both client and server to present valid certificates for authentication, ensuring trust from both sides.

### Q12: What is OCSP and how does it work?  
**A:**  
OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) allows clients to query a CA’s OCSP responder to check if a certificate is revoked, improving on traditional CRL methods.

### Q13: What is certificate pinning?  
**A:**  
Certificate pinning is the process of associating a host with its expected certificate or public key to prevent MITM attacks even if a CA is compromised.

## 7. Scenario-Based Questions

### Q14: How do you troubleshoot SSL handshake failures?  
**A:**  
- Verify certificates and key match.  
- Check certificate expiration and revocation status.  
- Ensure intermediate certificates are correctly installed.  
- Verify supported protocols and cipher suites.  
- Review server and client logs for errors.

### Q15: Your application uses mutual TLS but clients fail to connect. How do you debug?  
**A:**  
- Confirm clients have valid certificates signed by a trusted CA.  
- Verify the server truststore contains the client CA certificates.  
- Check the server’s SSL configuration for `ssl_verify_client on`.  
- Use `openssl s_client` to test connection with client certs.

## 8. Troubleshooting SSL on Common Servers

### 8.1 Nginx

- **Check error logs:**
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  ```
## Common errors

- `SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file` mismatch (private key and cert mismatch)  
- Missing intermediate certs  
- Incorrect file permissions on cert/key  
- Unsupported protocol or cipher suite by client  

**Verify cert and key match:**  
```bash
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5
```
Hashes should match.

### 8.2 Apache HTTPD
Check SSL error log:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log
```
### Common issues:

- AH02238: Unable to configure RSA server private key (key and cert mismatch)

- Missing intermediate CA in SSLCertificateChainFile or combined in SSLCertificateFile

- Incorrect SSLVerifyClient settings for two-way SSL

- Permissions on cert/key files

- Verify certificates: Use same OpenSSL commands as Nginx above.

### 8.3 Tomcat
Check Catalina logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
```
### Common problems:

- Keystore format issues (JKS vs PKCS12)

- Password mismatches

- Missing truststore or incorrect truststore passwords

- Incorrect clientAuth setting (false, want, true for mutual SSL)

Check keystore contents:
```bash
keytool -list -keystore keystore.jks
Convert PEM cert/key to PKCS12 for Tomcat:
```
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.crt -inkey server.key -out server.p12 -name tomcat
```
## 9. Troubleshooting Two-Way SSL (Mutual TLS)
### Ensure client sends certificate:
- Use openssl s_client with -cert and -key options to test.

### Verify server trusts client CA:
- Server must have client's CA cert in its truststore or ssl_client_certificate config.

### Check SSL logs for handshake errors:
- Look for messages like client certificate required or no shared cipher.

### Verify client certificate validity:
- Not expired, properly signed by trusted CA.

### Network issues:
- Ensure firewalls/security groups allow TCP 443 both ways.

## 10. Best Practices for SSL Management
- Use TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 only; disable SSL 2/3 and TLS 1.0/1.1.
- Use strong cipher suites (ECDHE, AES-GCM).
- Automate certificate renewals (e.g., Let’s Encrypt, Certbot).
- Regularly audit and revoke compromised certificates.
- Monitor SSL expiration and renew timely.
- Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers.
- Use mutual TLS where high security is needed.
