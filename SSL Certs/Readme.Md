- Learn how to replace SSL certs in Apache.  
- Troubleshoot common SSL errors in Apache HTTPD.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Replace expiring certs without downtime.  
- Resolve errors like cert-key mismatch.

---

## Step 7: Nginx SSL Replace & Troubleshooting  
**File:** `nginx_ssl_replace_guide.md`

- Perform SSL cert replacement on Nginx servers.  
- Debug Nginx-specific SSL issues.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Reload Nginx with new certs successfully.  
- Understand Nginx SSL logging and errors.

---

## Step 8: Tomcat SSL Replace & Keystore Management  
**File:** `tomcat_ssl_replace_guide.md`  
**Goal:**  
- Manage Java keystore (JKS/PKCS12) for Tomcat SSL.  
- Replace certs in Tomcat and troubleshoot keystore issues.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Convert PEM cert/key to PKCS12.  
- Restart Tomcat with new SSL config.

---

## Step 9: Java Keystore & PKCS12 Scenarios  
**File:** `ssl_jks_scenarios.md`  
**Goal:**  
- Understand various JKS and PKCS12 scenarios for SSL certs.  
- Practice importing certs, managing keystore entries.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Use keytool commands for keystore operations.  
- Handle chain cert imports.

---

## Step 10: SSL Certificate Monitoring with Prometheus  
**File:** `ssl_cert_monitoring_prometheus.md`  
**Goal:**  
- Learn how to monitor SSL cert expiration and health with Prometheus & Grafana.  
- Understand alerting on certificate expiry.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Set up Prometheus exporters for SSL certs.  
- Configure Grafana dashboard for SSL monitoring.

---

## Step 11: Interview Q&A Preparation  
**File:** `ssl_interview_guide.md`  
**Goal:**  
- Prepare for SSL-related interview questions covering beginner to advanced topics.  
- Study scenario-based and troubleshooting questions.  
**Checkpoint:**  
- Be comfortable answering questions on SSL concepts, cert management, two-way SSL, and troubleshooting.

# Additional Tips

- **Practice daily:** Implement commands and configs in a test environment (AWS EC2 or local VMs).  
- **Document your progress:** Keep notes and commands you used.  
- **Combine theory with practice:** Read concepts and immediately try them hands-on.  
- **Use openssl s_client and curl extensively** for testing.  
- **Ask questions or clarify doubts** as you study each step.
